# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Predictive-Analysis
This Project presents a comprehensive analysis of Telco customer churn, aiming to understand and predict customer attrition for a telecom company. It covers a range of data analysis and machine learning techniques implemented in Python, utilizing various libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow, and scikit-learn. The analysis delves into exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data preprocessing, and the implementation of multiple machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Network, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. The GitHub readme provides an in-depth walkthrough of the project, detailing each step from data collection and cleaning to model evaluation and conclusion.

The goal of the analysis is to uncover patterns and factors influencing customer churn, offering valuable insights for the telecom company's decision-making process. Through EDA, the project identifies associations between customer attributes, such as payment methods, contract types, and service usage, and the likelihood of churn. Machine learning models are then applied to predict customer churn, with Logistic Regression emerging as the top-performing model with an accuracy of 80.90%. The analysis not only showcases the technical implementation of machine learning but also emphasizes the practical applications of the findings, suggesting targeted strategies for marketing, customer service, and product improvement to mitigate churn and maximize revenue.

In conclusion, this project provides a thorough and well-documented analysis of Telco customer churn, demonstrating the power of data-driven insights in understanding customer behavior and predicting future churn. The project's applicability extends beyond the technical aspects, offering actionable recommendations for the telecom company to enhance customer retention strategies and maintain sustainable revenue growth.
